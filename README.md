The Problem: The "One-Size-Fits-All" Trap
Personalized tutoring is the most efficacious method of instruction, however, many students lack access to such resources, especially in preparation for examination like WASSCE. The traditional WAEC preparation uses a one-size-fits-all approach that doesn't cater to individual student needs. This leads to inefficient studying, frustration, and underperformance because students can't focus on their specific weaknesses.

This cycle of Generic Study Plans leads directly to Student Frustration and missed potential.
